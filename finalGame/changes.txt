Changes:
    1. Fixed the Player vs Food & Player vs Player Collisions logic in director.py so they work properly but they do not end the game properly
    2. Did work on handle_collisions.py and handle_game_over.py but it is not working properly, as described down in "Current Bugs"
    3. Fixed more comments throughout the program
    4. Added INVISIBLE_OPACITY to constants.py so we can turn an item's opacity invisible if needed
    5. Put both player1 & player2 into one new list named "players"
    6. Added a "clear_list" method in cast.py that clears the contents of an entire list which is planned to be used in handle_game_over.py to delete all of the remaining food when the game is over
    7. Changed the "get_actor" method in cast.py to allow you to look for the actor for any given index

Current Bugs:
    1. Game Over Logic Not Working
        1. If I remove the player from the "players" listwith the cast.remove_actor() method, the game doesn't recognize that line & has no effect
        2. If I set the player's opacity to zero(lines 110 & 118 of director.py), that makes the player invisible but they can still move around & eat food. We need to do one of these two: 1) disconnect the player from keyboard inputs so it can't move, or 2) find a way to remove the player from the "players" list

    2. Collisions Logic Not Working
        1. The collisions logic in the "for food in foods" loop (lines X-X of director.py) works fine for the food, but if I replace that code inside the for loop, it just infinitely increases the radius of the player & I'm not sure why it does that
        2. The PVP collisions logic only works if I make the player invisible instead of removing the player from the "players" list but I'm not sure why it does that
        2. I want to put the collisions logic code into handle_collisions.py instead of director.py but if we don't have time for that then it's will work as it is now

    3. clear_list Method Not Working -- might fix itself if we fix handle_game_over.py
        1. I added a "clear_list" method in cast.py that clears the contents of an entire list which is planned to be used in handle_game_over.py to delete all of the remaining food when the game is over but it is not working because the _handle_game_over method is not working either
