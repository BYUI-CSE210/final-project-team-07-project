Even though this current commit is a different commit from the previous commit, I'm just lumping the changes info together in this file since the prior commit was made only 1 hour ago
Changes:
    Prior Commit:
        1. Added the "get_list" method in cast.py to get an entire list as a whole instead of just the contents
        2. Removed PVP collisions from director.py so now the goal of the game is to collect as much food as possible instead of PVP
        3. Deleted the handle_collisions.py file because of change # 2
        4. Created the score.py file which created a new feature to allow players to gain points
        5. Fixed handle_game_over.py to compare player1's points & player2's points & determine a winner or tie
        6. Changed player2's keyboard inputs from IJKL to the directional keys
        7. Added code in director.py to draw player1's score, player2's score, and the game over message
        8. Added a "LIGHT_BLUE" color to the constants.py file which became the color of the player1 & player2 scores & game_over message
        7. Changed the "get_actor" method in cast.py to allow you to look for the actor for any given index
    Current Commit:
        1. Added a game over feature for when all food is collected: set each player's position to a hardcoded location & prevent them by moving by disconnecting their access to keyboard controls so the game truly ends
